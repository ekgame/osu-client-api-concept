# osu! client API concept
This project exists to plan out an API that would allow osu! client communicate and interact with third party desktop applications. This concept will most likely be realised once osu! becomes an open source project.

This project currently consists of the `concept.md` file. It should later be turned into a wiki, but this should be sufficient for now.

If you would like to contribute, submit an issue for a suggestion/feature request or make a pull request.
